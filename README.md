Hi everyone!!

I'm Rodrigo, as a technology enthusiastic I got my degree on mechanical enigineering which allowed me to work in one of the most passioneting and demanding industries, the Automotive. 
Currently, I'm looking for more opotunities improving my digital skills, important fact in this restless world changing day by day so rapidly. I'm really interested in `Machine Learning` world, specially `Deep Learning`, field I'd like to get deeper and eventually become an AI expert, in fact, I've just finished my master on `Big Data` which final project I focused on artificial vision. You can take a look at it on my profile itself [Lung-Disease-Classifer](https://github.com/rovaldel/TFM-Lung-Disease-Classifier).
Besides, `Cloud Computing` and web desing are now on my agenda being my `Stack MEAN (Mongo, Express, Node y Angular)`.
If you're looking for a new enthusiastic, pragmatic and passionated colleague just contact me.
